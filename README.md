### Hi there 👋, I'm Isaac Weiss!

I'm a budding software engineer with a knack for back-end development and a penchant for creating robust web solutions. My journey in tech began at Auburn University, where I honed my skills in a full-stack co-op, developing over 30 web applications that serve the Auburn community. I'm fluent in a symphony of programming languages, including C#, C++, Java, Python, Swift, and SQL, and I'm well-versed in the .NET ecosystem.

🔭 I’m currently polishing my skills in Entity Framework, LINQ, and Razor while pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science, with a minor in French and a concentration in Business.

🌱 I’m on a continuous learning curve, currently diving deeper into the intricacies of back-end frameworks and database management systems.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and innovative web applications that challenge the status quo.

💬 Ask me about my experience as a web developer, my time as an exchange student in France, or my role in orchestrating a 24-hour Hackathon!

📫 How to reach me: Drop me an email at weissic@icloud.com or visit my personal website at www.isaacweiss.dev for a deeper dive into my projects and experiences.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm likely immersing myself in different cultures or learning a new language.
